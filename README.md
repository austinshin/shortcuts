# shortcuts

### terminal recommendations: 
**iterm2** (custom hotkeys, tabs, terminal multiplexer, custom colors, built in
tmux)  
There's other ones like kitty, hyper, macterm etc. choose what you want (esp if you like to customize even further). iterm2 I find is suitable for my needs.


---

### terminal plugins (optional):   
**learn how to write alias commands**  
**tmux** - sessions/multiplexer (built into iterm2)   
**zshrc** - plugins for customizing terminal more

### mac useful tools:
= signs means they do the equivalent with slightly different features. the first one in each list is
what I use.  
1. **insomniaX = lighthead = amphetamine** - disable idle/lid sleep config  
2. **insomnia = postman = curl** - send http requests to servers
3. **bettertouchtools = spectale** - hotkeys for your mac and window snapping
   easily)  
4. **macdown = dillinger.io** - markdown editor (good for editing README's or keeping track of notes. I also recommended using octopress and creating a blog for that)

### text editors:   
**vim!**  
**vscode**  
**atom**  
**sublime text 2/3**
