# shortcuts

terminal recommendation: iterm2 (custom hotkeys, tabs, terminal multiplexer, custom colors, built in
tmux)
terminal plugin: tmux/zshrc - sessions/multiplexer/plugins

mac useful tools:
= signs means they do the equivalent with slightly different features. the first one in each list is
what I use.
1. insomniaX = lighthead = amphetamine - disable idle/lid sleep config
2. insomnia = postman = curl - send http requests
3. siege npm = siege brew install = artillery - npm modules to stress test
4. bettertouchtools = spectale - hotkeys for your mac and window snapping
5. trello - ticketing website (there's an extension on chrome to create parent/child relationships
   easily)
6. docker - setting up containers/vm for your app
