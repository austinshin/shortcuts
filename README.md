# shortcuts

terminal recommendation: iterm2 (custom hotkeys, tabs, terminal multiplexer, custom colors, built in
tmux)
terminal plugin: tmux/zshrc - sessions/multiplexer/plugins

mac useful tools:
= signs means they do the equivalent with slightly different features. the first one in each list is
what I use.
1. insomniaX = lighthead = amphetamine - disable idle/lid sleep config
2. insomnia = postman = curl - send http requests
3. bettertouchtools = spectale - hotkeys for your mac and window snapping
   easily)
4. macdown = dillinger.io - markdown editor (good for editing README's or keeping track of notes. I
   also recommended using octopress and creating a blog for that)

text editors: vim/vscode/atom/sublime text

must have plugins for your text editor-
